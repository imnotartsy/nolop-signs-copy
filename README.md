### Signs, forms, labels, and machine usage guides that we make for the makerspace

### A few other notes

* The SVG files should generally be edited with Inkscape.
* The store price list is generated from https://nolop.org/store/ as a PDF, then printed on paper. This is so that we have one canonical price list available online and in real life.
* The default font for signs is Liberation Sans, which is metrically compatible with Arial on non-free platforms.
